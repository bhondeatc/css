    <h2>CSS Overflow hidden</h2>
    <p>
        By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box:
    </p>
    <div class="hidden">
        You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout.
        The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.
    </div>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<!-- overflow auto -->
	<h2>CSS Overflow auto</h2>
    <p>
        Setting the overflow value to scroll,
        the overflow is clipped and a scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box.
        Note that this will add a scrollbar both horizontally and vertically
        (even if you do not need it):
    </p>
    <div class="auto">
